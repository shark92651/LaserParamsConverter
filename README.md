# LaserParamsConverter
Converts parameter settings and libraries for different laser engraver wattages and lens sizes. Support EZCAD2 and LightBurn parameter library file types.

This project came about as I wanted a way to quickly convert an entire laser parameter library from a different wattage and/or lens size without having to manually convert, edit, and save each individual parameter group by hand. This utility will read and write both LightBurn and EZCad2 parameter file formats, and also includes a conversion calculator tool.

WARNING: Please make a backup copy of any library file before use! This software is offered for free, there is no warranty, and the user accepts all risk of it's use.

Installation
There is no setup program offered at this time. Just make a folder and copy all the files to the folder and run the LaserParamsConverter.exe. This software requires .Net 6.0 Runtime. If the required .Net Runtime is not installed on your system, a link will be provided in order to downoad and install the Runtime. This software has only been tested on Windows 10, but since .Net 6.0 includes cross-platform support, it could possibly also run on Linux and MacOS.
